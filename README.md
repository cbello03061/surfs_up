## Summary

The months analyzed show us that June, due to the number of hot days, will be a good month for sales, on the other hand, in December, one should think that in addition to ice cream, one should think about putting a different attraction in the surf shop or reducing inventories. of ice cream to avoid losses. I would analyze the months from October to February to take into account the number of cold days that the new store has to face, and I would also analyze the cyclone and hurricane season to have all the aspects of the weather.
